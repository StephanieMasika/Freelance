# DISSERTATION
## DEFINITION
The words dissertation and thesis are often used interchangeably.

In the U.S, a thesis is usually completed at the end of a masters level degree and a dissertation is completed for a PhD or doctoral degree. In the U.K and some other countries, it is vice versa.

Dissertation and thesis are both formal academic research projects and they both follow the same process

## PROCESS OF WRITING A DISSERTATION/THESIS
Broadly speaking, there are eight steps to the dissertation/thesis journey. These steps are:
1. Understand what it is: you need to clearly understand what a dissertation/thesis is
2. Find a research topic: the research topic has to be unique and valuable. Besides the topic, you need research questions.
3. Craft a research proposal: the proposal has to be persuasive to convince your university that your topic is suitable and manageable.
4. Write your Introduction chapter: this is the first chapter of your dissertation. It should provide a clear description and justification of your research.
5. Review existing literature: synthesize the current literature in your area
6. Design your own research: design a rigorous methodology and undertake your own research
7. Report your findings
8. Draw your conclusion
