# TIOR GAMES CASE STUDY
Tior Games is dedicated to providing an exceptional player experience as its primary objective. To ensure a consistent, fast, and always-available high-quality player experience for its global user base, Tior Games focuses on its most popular and lucrative game, League of Fun (LoF). LoF, a free-to-play game with in-game purchases, operates as a computer-based MOBA.

Given the widespread popularity of LoF, Tior Games hosts World Championships biannually, in January and September, for competitive and professional teams. The awards and event popularity have grown each year, mirroring the overall rise in gaming industry and community interest.

A few years ago, Tior Gaming migrated its entire data warehouse to Amazon AWS, specifically using Hive. As a user with access to a segment of the company's data warehouse managed by their DBA, the data is centered around the previous World Championships starting from 2016. The structure employs a snowflake schema, encompassing game data, champion data, player information, and event details.

The objective is to analyze the accessible data and propose strategies for Tior Gaming to enhance both player and spectator experiences, boost the World Championship's popularity, and overall improve profitability. The proposed solution involves querying the data within the data warehouse and subsequently creating a visual business presentation for Tior's Board of Executives
