# OVERVIEW: HAPPYPHONES LTD
Happyphone LTD is a limited company, delivering mobile communications services in the UK. Happyphone LTD has approximately 53 retail stores, and services more than 1 million connections across its mobile network.
Happyphone LTD is currently using an outdated customer service system and they are looking to improve it.
In the current system, when a customer calls the helpline, they have 3 choices, either to go to sales or to connections or to “other”. This is not very efficient and does not cover the workload of the company, since its growth. When a customer selects an option then they may wait up to 2 hours to be connected with a representative.
The representative, based on their expertise, may or may not be able to answer the customer’s inquiry.
The top 3 queries the Happyphone LTD are getting from their customers are:
1.    Lost/stolen phone inquiries
2.    Bill inquiries
3.    Connectivity issues

If the customer is not satisfied with the response or if the representative is unable to answer, then the customer’s query is escalated and the customer is connected to the second line of customer service, which deals with more complicated queries.
After the escalation takes place, if the customer is happy then the query is resolved or if there are still issues, the customer is then connected to the daily customer services manager. Happyphone LTD has two customer service managers, who alternate their customer service problem solving duties daily. At that stage, the manager must solve the problem, one way or another.

They are looking to identify problems around customer support and knowledge base management.
